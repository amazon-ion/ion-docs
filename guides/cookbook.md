This cookbook provides code samples for some simple Amazon Ion use cases.

## How to use this cookbook

For readability, all examples of Ion data used in this cookbook will be
represented in the text Ion format, even examples intended to represent binary
Ion data. To make clear which format is represented by the example, each Ion
snippet will begin with a comment that denotes either `TEXT` or `BINARY`.

For brevity, this cookbook will make use of methods and global variables.
Variables declared inside methods are in scope only within that method.
Variables declared outside of methods, and methods themselves, are in scope
until the next horizontal rule (such as the one that follows this section).
Within the same scope, variables with the same name and type or methods with the
same signature should be considered interchangeable.

In some cases, the examples herein depend on code external to Ion (e.g.
constructing input streams to read files), which is out of scope for this
cookbook. Code such as this will be replaced by a method with an empty (but
implied) implementation.

> *Java*
> 
> Import statements for classes internal to the Ion library or to `java.lang`
> are omitted. Other external classes will either be first referenced by their
> fully-qualified names, or will be preceded by an import statement. Import
> statements have global scope.

## Getting started

> *Java*
> 
> The [`IonSystem`][3] interface provides many utilities in ion-java.
> When an `IonSystem` is required, a single instance generally should be
> constructed and used throughout the application.
> 
> Below, an `IonSystem` instance that will be reused throughout this cookbook 
> will be constructed.
> 
> ```java
> static final IonSystem SYSTEM = IonSystemBuilder.standard().build();
> ```

## Reading and Writing Ion Data

> *Java*
> 
> Implementations of the [`IonReader`][4] and [`IonWriter`][5] interfaces are
> responsible for reading and writing Ion data in both its text and binary forms.
> 
> `IonReader`s and `IonWriter`s may be constructed through builders.
>
> An [`IonReaderBuilder`][16] with the default configuration may be constructed as
> follows. This builder will construct `IonReader` instances which can read
> both text and binary Ion data.
>
> ```java
> IonReaderBuilder readerBuilder = IonReaderBuilder.standard();
> ```
>
> An [`IonTextWriterBuilder`][6] with the default configuration may be constructed
> as follows. This builder will construct `IonWriter` instances which output data
> in the text Ion format.
> 
> ```java
> IonTextWriterBuilder textWriterBuilder = IonTextWriterBuilder.standard();
> ```
>
> To construct a builder that constructs `IonWriter` instances which output data
> in the binary Ion format, use an [`IonBinaryWriterBuilder`][15].
>
> ```java
> IonBinaryWriterBuilder binaryWriterBuilder = IonBinaryWriterBuilder.standard();
> ```
>
> Each of the aforementioned builders may be used to construct multiple `IonReader`
> or `IonWriter` instances with the same configuration.
>
> Consider the following text Ion data, which has been materialized as a Java
> String.
> 
> ```java
> String helloWorld = "{ hello:\"world\" }";
> ```
> 
> An `IonReader` for this data may be constructed as follows.
> 
> ```java
> IonReader reader = readerBuilder.build(helloWorld);
> ```
> 
> Reading the data requires leveraging the `IonReader`'s APIs.
> 
> ```java
> void readHelloWorld() {
>     reader.next();                            // position the reader at the first value, a struct
>     reader.stepIn();                          // step in to the struct
>     reader.next();                            // position the reader at the first value in the struct
>     String hello = reader.getFieldName();     // retrieve the current value's field name
>     String world = reader.stringValue();      // retrieve the current value's String value
>     reader.stepOut();                         // step out of the struct
>     System.out.println(hello + " " + world);  // prints "hello world"
> }
> ```
> 
> In the above example, the `helloWorld` text Ion was probably typed by a human
> using a text editor. The following example will illustrate how it could have
> been generated using an `IonWriter`.
> 
> Assume the desired sink for the generated Ion data is a
> [`java.io.OutputStream`][10], e.g. a [`java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`][11].
> 
> ```java
> ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
> ```
> 
> The first step when creating an `IonWriter` is to decide whether it should
> emit text Ion or binary Ion.
> 
> As mentioned above, text `IonWriter`s are constructed by `IonTextWriterBuilder`s.
> 
> ```java
> IonWriter writer = textWriterBuilder.build(out);
> ```
> 
> Similarly, binary `IonWriter`s are constructed by `IonBinaryWriterBuilder`s.
> 
> ```java
> IonWriter writer = binaryWriterBuilder.build(out);
> ```
> 
> Since both text and binary `IonWriter`s conform to the same interface, the
> same APIs are used for both.
> 
> ```java
> import java.io.IOException;
> 
> void writeHelloWorld(IonWriter writer) throws IOException {
>     writer.stepIn(IonType.STRUCT);  // step into a struct
>     writer.setFieldName("hello");   // set the field name for the next value to be written
>     writer.writeString("world");    // write the next value
>     writer.stepOut();               // step out of the struct
> }
> ```
> 
> The following demonstrates using `writeHelloWorld` with a text `IonWriter`.
> 
> ```java
> void writeHelloWorldText() throws IOException {
>     try (IonWriter textWriter = textWriterBuilder.build(out)) {
>         writeHelloWorld(textWriter);
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Regardless of whether `out` was written with text or binary Ion data, it may
> now be read using an `IonReader`.
> 
> ```java
> import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
> import java.io.InputStream;
> 
> void readHelloWorldAgain() {
>     byte[] data = out.toByteArray();                // may contain either text or binary Ion data
>     InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);
>     reader = readerBuilder.build(in);
>     readHelloWorld();                               // prints "hello world"
> }
> ```

## Formatting Ion text output

### Pretty-printing

To aid human-readability, Ion text supports "pretty" output. Consider the
following un-formatted text Ion:

```
 { level1:{ level2:{ level3:"foo" }, x:2 }, y:[a,b,c] }
```

Pretty-printing results in output similar to the following:

```
 {
   level1:{
     level2:{
       level3:"foo"
     },
     x:2
   },
   y:[
     a,
     b,
     c
   ]
 }
```

> *Java*
> 
> Ion data can be pretty-printed using an `IonWriter` constructed by a specially-configured
> `IonTextWriterBuilder`.
> 
> ```java
> 
> String unformatted = "{ level1:{ level2:{ level3:\"foo\" }, x:2 }, y:[a,b,c] }";
> 
> void rewrite(String textIon, IonWriter writer) throws IOException {
>     IonReader reader = IonReaderBuilder.standard().build(textIon);
>     writer.writeValues(reader);
> }
> 
> void prettyPrint() throws IOException {
>     StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
>     try (IonWriter prettyWriter = IonTextWriterBuilder.pretty().build(stringBuilder)) {
>         rewrite(unformatted, prettyWriter);
>     }
>     System.out.println(stringBuilder.toString());
> }
> ```

### Down-converting to JSON

Because Ion has a richer type system than JSON, converting Ion to JSON is lossy.
Nevertheless, applications may have use cases that require them to
down-convert Ion data for JSON compatibility.

During this conversion, the following rules are applied:

  1. Nulls of any type are converted to JSON *null*
  2. Arbitrary precision integers are printed as JSON *number* with precision
     preserved
  3. Floats are printed as JSON *number* with `nan` and `+-inf` converted to
     JSON *null*
  4. Decimals are printed as JSON *number* with precision preserved
  5. Timestamps are printed as JSON *string*
  6. Symbols are printed as JSON *string*
  7. Strings are printed as JSON *string*
  8. Clobs are ASCII-encoded for characters between 32 (`0x20`) and 126
     (`0x7e`), inclusive. Characters from 0 (`0x00`) to 31 (`0x1f`) and from
     127 (`0x7f`) to 255 (`0xff`) are escaped as Unicode code points `U+00XX`
     (e.g. `0x7f` is `U+007f`, represented by `\u007f` in JSON)
  9. Blobs are printed as Base64-encoded JSON *string*s
  10. Structs are printed as JSON *object*
  11. Lists are printed as JSON *array*
  12. S-expressions are printed as JSON *array*
  13. Annotations are suppressed
  14. All struct field names are printed as JSON *string*s (i.e. they are
      quoted)
  15. Any trailing commas in container values are removed

Consider the following text Ion:

```
 { data:annot::{ foo:null.string, bar:(2 + 2) }, time:1969-07-20T20:18Z }
```

Down-converting into JSON results in output similar to the following:

```json
 {
     "data":{
         "foo":null,
         "bar":[
             2,
             "+",
             2
         ]
     },
     "time":"1969-07-20T20:18Z"
 }
```

For JSON compatibility, all field names were converted to JSON *string*, the
null `"foo"` field lost its type information, `"bar"` was converted into a
JSON *list* (losing its S-expression semantics), and `"time"` was represented
as a JSON *string*.

> *Java*
> 
> Using the `rewrite` method from the previous example, the data can be
> down-converted for JSON compatibility.
> 
> ```java
> 
> String textIon = "{ data:annot::{ foo:null.string, bar:(2 + 2) }, time:1969-07-20T20:18Z }";
> 
> void downconvertToJson() throws IOException {
>     StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
>     try (IonWriter jsonWriter = IonTextWriterBuilder.json().withPrettyPrinting().build(stringBuilder)) {
>         rewrite(textIon, jsonWriter);
>     }
>     System.out.println(stringBuilder.toString());
> }
> ```

### Migrating JSON data to Ion

Because Ion is a superset of JSON, valid JSON data is valid Ion data. As such, 
Ion readers are capable of reading JSON data without any special
configuration. When reading data that was encoded by a JSON writer, the
following Ion text parsing rules should be kept in mind:

  1. Field names are interpreted as Ion symbols (i.e. quotes are removed when
     possible)
  2. Numeric values without a decimal point are interpreted as Ion integers
  3. Numeric values with a decimal point but without an exponent are interpreted
     as Ion decimals
  4. Numeric values with exponents are interpreted as Ion floats
  
Consider the following JSON data:

```json-doc
 // TEXT
 {
   "data":{
     "foo":null,
     "bar":[
       2,
       "+",
       2
      ]
   },
   "time":"1969-07-20T20:18Z"
 }
```

Converting this data to Ion (possibly via one of the pretty-printing examples)
results in the following:

```
 {
   data:{
     foo:null,
     bar:[
       2,
       "+",
       2
     ]
   },
   time:"1969-07-20T20:18Z"
 }
```

This is clearly valid Ion, but is no longer valid JSON (because field names
are unquoted). And, notably, it is **not** the same as the original Ion data
that was down-converted to JSON.

### Reading numeric types

Because Ion has richly defined numeric types, there are often multiple possible
representations of a numeric Ion value.

> *Java*
> 
> Integer values that can fit into a Java `int` may be read as such using
> `IonReader.intValue()`, or may be read into a `long` using
> `IonReader.longValue()`, or a [`java.math.BigInteger`][12] using
> `IonReader.bigIntegerValue()`.
> 
> Consider the following Ion list of numeric values, which has been materialized
> into a Java String.
> 
> ```java
> String numberList = "[ 1.23456, 123456, 1.2345e6, ]";
> ```
> 
> The following example illustrates the equivalence of using different
> `IonReader` APIs to read the same numeric value.
> 
> ```java
> import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
> import java.math.BigDecimal;
> import java.math.BigInteger;
> 
> void readNumericTypes() throws IOException {
> 
>     // expected values
>     BigDecimal first = new BigDecimal("1.23456");
>     BigInteger second = new BigInteger("123456");
>     double third = 1.2345e6;
> 
>     IonReader reader = IonReaderBuilder.standard().build(numberList);
>     reader.next();
>     reader.stepIn();
> 
>     assertEquals(IonType.DECIMAL, reader.next());
>     assertEquals(first, reader.bigDecimalValue());
>     assertEquals(first.doubleValue(), reader.doubleValue(), 1e-9);
> 
>     assertEquals(IonType.INT, reader.next());
>     assertEquals(second, reader.bigIntegerValue());
>     assertEquals(second.longValue(), reader.longValue());
>     assertEquals(second.intValue(), reader.intValue());
> 
>     assertEquals(IonType.FLOAT, reader.next());
>     assertEquals(third, reader.doubleValue(), 1e-9);
> 
>     reader.stepOut();
> }
> ```
> 
> Note that care must be taken to avoid data loss. For example, reading an integer
> value too large to fit in a Java `int` using `IonReader.intValue()` will
> result in loss.

## Performing sparse reads

One of the major benefits of binary Ion is the ability to efficiently perform
sparse reads.

Consider the following stream of binary Ion data.

```
 // BINARY
 $ion_1_0
 foo::{
     quantity:1
 }
 bar::{
     name:"x",
     id:7
 }
 baz::{
     items:["thing1", "thing2"]
 }
 foo::{
     quantity:19
 }
 bar::{
     name:"y",
     id:8
 }
 // the stream continues...
```

The following examples simulate an application whose only purpose is to sum the
`quantity` fields of each `foo` struct in the stream. This is achieved by
examining the type annotations of each top-level struct and comparing against
`"foo"`. Because binary Ion is length-prefixed, when the struct's annotation does
not match `"foo"`, the reader can quickly skip to the start of the next value.

> *Java*
> 
> ```java
> InputStream getStream() {
>     // return an InputStream representation of the above data
> }
> 
> int sumFooQuantities() {
>     IonReader reader = IonReaderBuilder.standard().build(getStream());
>     int sum = 0;
>     IonType type;
>     while ((type = reader.next()) != null) {
>         if (type == IonType.STRUCT) {
>             String[] annotations = reader.getTypeAnnotations();
>             if (annotations.length > 0 && annotations[0].equals("foo")) {
>                 reader.stepIn();
>                 while ((type = reader.next()) != null) {
>                     if (reader.getFieldName().equals("quantity")) {
>                         sum += reader.intValue();
>                         break;
>                     }
>                 }
>                 reader.stepOut();
>             }
>         }
>     }
>     return sum;
> }
> ```

## Converting non-hierarchical data to Ion

Although Ion is a hierarchical format, it can be used to represent
non-hierarchical data in a more efficient way than many other hierarchical
formats, notably JSON.

Consider a use case that requires converting CSV data to Ion. Performing this
conversion to JSON or XML results in an inefficient encoding due to repetitive
duplication of column names. Ion can mitigate this drawback through use of
symbol tables.

Consider the following CSV in a file called `test.csv`.

```
 id,type,state
 1,foo,false
 2,bar,true
 3,baz,true
 ...
```
    
An application that wishes to convert this data into the Ion format can
generate a symbol table containing the column names. This reduces encoding size
and improves read efficiency.

### Using a local symbol table

Local symbol tables are managed internally by Ion readers and writers. No
application configuration is required to tell Ion readers or writers that local
symbol tables should be used.

> *Java*
> 
> Start by retrieving an object that can parse `test.csv` line-by-line, e.g. a
> [`java.io.BufferedReader`][13].
> 
> ```java
> BufferedReader getCsvReader() { /*...*/ }
> ```
> 
> The code that actually performs the conversion will use this to parse each line
> of the CSV and write its components to an IonWriter.
> 
> ```java
> void convertCsvToIon(IonWriter writer) throws IOException {
>     BufferedReader reader = getCsvReader();
>     reader.readLine(); // skip over the column labels
>     String row;
>     while ((row = reader.readLine()) != null) {
>         String[] cells = row.split(",");
>         writer.stepIn(IonType.STRUCT);
>         writer.setFieldName("id");
>         writer.writeInt(Integer.parseInt(cells[0]));
>         writer.setFieldName("type");
>         writer.writeString(cells[1]);
>         writer.setFieldName("state");
>         writer.writeBool(Boolean.parseBoolean(cells[2]));
>         writer.stepOut();
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Writing the CSV data as Ion using a local symbol table is as simple as using one
> of the techniques exhibited earlier in this cookbook to construct an
> `IonWriter`, passing it to the `convertCsvToIon` method, and closing
> it when finished.
> 
> ```java
> void convertCsvToIonUsingLocalSymbolTable(OutputStream output) throws IOException {
>     try (IonWriter writer = IonBinaryWriterBuilder.standard().build(output)) {
>         convertCsvToIon(writer);
>     }
> }
> ```

### Using a shared symbol table

Using local symbol tables requires the local symbol table (including all of its
symbols) to be written at the beginning of the value stream. Consider an Ion
stream that represents CSV data with many columns. Although local symbol tables
will optimize writing and reading each value, including the entire symbol
table itself in the value stream adds overhead that increases with the number
of columns.

If it is feasible for the writers and readers of the stream to agree on a
pre-defined shared symbol table, this overhead can be reduced.

#### Writing

Consider the following shared symbol table that declares the column names of
`test.csv` as symbols. Note that the shared symbol table may have been
generated by hand or programmatically.

```
 // TEXT
 $ion_shared_symbol_table::{
     name: "test.csv.columns"
     version: 1
     symbols: ["id", "type", "state"]
 }
```

This shared symbol table can be stored in a file (or in a database) to be
resurrected into a symbol table at runtime.

> *Java*
> 
> ```java
> InputStream getSharedSymbolTableStream() {
>     // get an InputStream over the 'test.csv.columns' shared symbol table.
> }
> 
> SymbolTable getSharedSymbolTable() {
>     IonReader symbolTableReader = IonReaderBuilder.standard().build(getSharedSymbolTableStream());
>     return SYSTEM.newSharedSymbolTable(symbolTableReader);
> }
> ```
> 
> Note that an equivalent shared symbol table could be constructed
> programmatically.
> 
> ```java
> SymbolTable getSharedSymbolTable() {
>     Iterator<String> symbols = Arrays.asList("id", "type", "state").iterator();
>     return SYSTEM.newSharedSymbolTable("test.csv.columns", 1, symbols);
> }
> ```
> 
> Now, an `IonWriter` that is configured to use the symbols from the shared
> symbol table is constructed, passed to the `convertCsvToIon` method from
> above, and closed when finished.
> 
> ```java
> void convertCsvToIonUsingSharedSymbolTable(OutputStream output) throws IOException {
>     SymbolTable shared = getSharedSymbolTable();
>     try (IonWriter writer = IonBinaryWriterBuilder.standard().withImports(shared).build(output)) {
>         convertCsvToIon(writer);
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Rather than writing a local symbol table that grows with the number of columns,
> this technique simply includes a symbol table at the beginning of the stream
> that imports the shared symbol table. (Note that, in addition, any symbols
> written but not included in the shared symbol table will be declared in the
> symbol table that begins the stream.)

#### Reading

Because the value stream written using the shared symbol table does not contain
the symbol mappings, a reader of the stream needs to access the shared symbol
table using a catalog.

> *Java*
> 
> The [`IonCatalog`][8] interface may be implemented by applications to provide
> customized shared symbol table retrieval logic, such as retrieval from an external
> source.
> 
> ion-java includes an implementation of `IonCatalog` called [`SimpleCatalog`][9],
> which stores shared symbol tables in memory and will be used here for
> illustration purposes.
> 
> Creating `IonReader`s capable of parsing streams written with shared symbol
> tables starts with correctly configuring an `IonReaderBuilder`. Reusing the
> `getSharedSymbolTable` method from above, this can be done as follows.
> 
> ```java
> IonReaderBuilder getReaderBuilderWithCatalog() {
>     SimpleCatalog catalog = new SimpleCatalog();
>     catalog.putTable(getSharedSymbolTable());
>     return IonReaderBuilder.standard().withCatalog(catalog);
> }
> ```
> 
> The resulting `IonReaderBuilder` may be used to instantiate `IonReader`s capable
> of interpreting the shared symbols encountered in the value stream written in the
> previous sub-section.
