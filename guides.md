We have written a collection of guides that are designed to help you use Ion. If there are other guides that you would like to see, let us know through one of the [ways to contact us][1]!

[The Cookbook][2] contains samples for some simple Amazon Ion use cases with examples in Java. The samples include reading and writing Ion data, formatting Ion text, performing sparse reads, and converting non-hierarchical data to Ion.

[Why Ion?][3] discusses features that differentiate Amazon Ion from other formats. Some of those features are Ion's dual-format interoperability, rich type system, self-describing format, read-optimized binary format.
