== Macro Signatures

include::styles.adoc[]

A macro's _signature_ defines the syntax of expressions that invoke it, and the set of input values
it accepts.
Signatures constrain both E-expressions and macro-language invocations.
Because they denote the interface for users of macros, we describe them independently of macro
definitions.

A signature consists of a sequence of named parameter specifications, followed by an optional result
specification.

Each parameter in a signature has a name, expressed as an Ion identifier symbol.
Restricting names to Java-style identifiers enables use of operator characters (like `?` and
`{asterisk}`) for the syntax surrounding names, including qualified macro references.


=== Parameter Shapes

A macro’s “wire format”—the sequence of acceptable tokens in an E-expression—is determined by its
parameters’ shapes.
The base type constrains the syntax that can be used for each argument supplied to the
parameter.
Independently, a parameter is either _simple_ or a _rest parameter_; this dimension
determines how the arguments supplied to the parameter are delimited within the overall invocation.

=== Base Types

The core of a parameter specification is its base type, which constrains the syntax of each
argument (that is, the acceptable expression forms that can be used).

include::grammar.adoc[tag=param-types]
|===

The _concrete types_ correspond to the usual Ion data types, from `null` and `bool` through
`list` and `struct`.
These have the obvious meanings, with the caveat that annotations are allowed, as are
appropriately-typed _and untyped_ nulls.
For example, the inputs `null.int` and `null.null` are acceptable to an `int`-typed argument,
as are arbitrary annotations on either.

|===

The _abstract types_ are select supertypes of the concrete types: `text` accepts both `symbol`
and `string`; `number` accepts `int`, `decimal`, and `float`; `lob` accepts `blob` and `clob`;
`sequence` accepts `list` and `sexp`; `any` accepts any value.
Nulls and annotations are accepted as with the concrete types.

include::grammar.adoc[tag=abstract-type]
|===

Collectively, the abstract and concrete types are the _tagged types_.
Parameters of these types can use macro invocations in place of normal values.

The _primitive types_ are subtypes of various concrete types that have particularly compact
binary encodings.
These include variable-length strings, symbols, signed ``int``s, unsigned ``uint``s,
as well as fixed-width ``int``s, ``uint``s, and ``float``s, all of various widths between 8 and
64 bits.
These types are untagged, so they do not accept nulls, annotations, or macro invocations.

Finally, any visible macro can be used as a type, in which case the argument is written (in text)
as an S-expression with elements matching that macro’s signature.
As with tagless arguments, these arguments are serialized without any explicit indication of
their type, since that’s implied by context.
(Using a zero-parameter macro as a parameter type is acceptable but pointless, since the result is constant.)


=== Cardinality

Each parameter specification includes a _cardinality_ that indicates the number of values that it
expects its argument(s) to produce.

[{bnf}]
|===
include::grammar.adoc[tag=cardinality]
|===

The following cardinality modifiers are available:

* `?` denotes a parameter that accepts zero or one value.
* `!` denotes a parameter that accepts exactly one value.
* `{asterisk}` denotes a parameter that accepts zero or more values.
* `+` denotes a parameter that accepts one or more values.

Cardinality is verified by the Ion implementation: the expansion system will signal an expansion
error if the number of values produced by the argument(s) is not aligned with the declared
cardinality.


=== Rest Parameters

The last parameter may be a _rest parameter_, which is effectively an implicitly grouped
parameter.
In text invocations, these parameters don’t use group delimiters, but instead take “all the
rest” of the argument expressions.

To declare a rest parameter, use one of the two special cardinality modifiers:

* `\...` denotes a parameter that accepts zero or more values.
* `\...+` denotes a parameter that accepts one or more values.

Examples:

[{nrm}]
----
(counts int \...)      // Accepts zero or more ints
(points point \...+)   // Accepts one or more points
----


=== Voidable and Optional Parameters

Parameters with cardinality accepting zero values (declared with modifiers `?`, `*`, or `\...`)
are called _voidable_ because their resulting value streams can be void.
A parameter is _optional_ when it is voidable and all following parameters are voidable.

Optional parameters are given special treatment in text invocations: their arguments can be
omitted entirely, as long as all following arguments are also omitted.


=== Arity

The _minimum arity_ of a macro is equal to the number of leading non-optional parameters.
Assuming no rest-parameter, the _maximum arity_ of the macro is the total number of declared
parameters.
A macro with a rest-parameter has no maximum arity.
A macro with equal minimum and maximum arity is _fixed arity_; other templates are _variable
arity_.


=== Result Specification

To enable more robust and easier-to-debug templates, a signature can express a _result
specification_ that constrains the data that it produces.
Results are specified by their type (abstract or concrete) and cardinality.
Both factors are verified by the macro expander when the macro is invoked.
