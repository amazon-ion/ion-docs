# {{ page.title }}

The Amazon Ion data model is covered in the [Specification document][1]. It primarily covers the data types and text format. The text format is also covered more formally by the [ANTLR grammar][3]. There is a separate document for the [Binary format][2].

[Symbols][8] are a critical component to the performance and space-efficiency of Ion. There are also some important things to note about [Decimal support][4], [Float support][5], and how Ion handles [Strings and Clobs][7]. If you see some terms that you are not familiar with, check out the [Glossary][6].
