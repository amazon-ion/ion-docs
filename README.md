## Development

To test locally, you must have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), 
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/), [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html),
and [mdbook-alerts](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-alerts#user-content-usage) installed.

In the project root directory, run:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can now view the GitHub pages site in your favorite browser, served from your computer.

For full information about testing GitHub pages sites locally, see the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) on GitHub.
