From version 1.4.0 forward ion-java has moved to a new maven group id and java package name: `com.amazon.ion`. This move was necessary to keep the publishing of Amazon libraries in maven consistent.

We'll keep supporting `software.amazon.ion` by publishing mirrored releases but users are strongly encouraged to migrate. The migration is trivial, the only differences are the maven group id and Java package names.

1.4.0 release notes:

* First release using `com.amazon.ion` as the java package name and groupId
* Fixed a gzipped related memory leak
* Performance fix for IonValueLite.clearSymbolIdValues()
