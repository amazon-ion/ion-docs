This release is a complete implementation of the [Ion Hash Specification](https://amazon-ion.github.io/ion-hash/docs/spec.html). In addition to low-level `hash_reader`/`hash_writer` APIs, it adds an `ion_hash()` method to all [ion-python](https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-python) simpleion objects.

This package is available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ionhash/).
