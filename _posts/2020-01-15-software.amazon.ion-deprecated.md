As of today the `software.amazon.ion` group id is deprecated in favor of `com.amazon.ion` and no new software will be released in maven using `software.amazon.ion`.

Users are encouraged to migrate as soon as possible. The only changes are in the package names so they conform to the corresponding group ids.
