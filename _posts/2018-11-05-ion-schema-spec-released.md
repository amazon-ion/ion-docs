This new specification describes a language and set of constraints used to declaratively constrain Ion values.  Types defined by a schema could be used to:
* assert that a value meets specific expectations,
* generate developer-friendly APIs for working with data,
* enable efficient analysis over data that conforms to a type,
* and more!

A reference implementation of Ion Schema is now available as open source software.  It is written in Kotlin, and should be considered alpha software.
