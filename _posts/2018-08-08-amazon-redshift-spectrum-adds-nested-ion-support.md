You can now use Amazon Redshift to directly query nested data in Apache Parquet, Apache ORC, JSON and Amazon Ion file formats stored in external tables in Amazon S3.

Nested data support with Redshift Spectrum enables you to query complex data types such as struct, array, or map, without having to transform or load your data.
