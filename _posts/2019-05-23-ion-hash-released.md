title: "Ion Hash Specification 1.0 Released"

This new specification defines a hash algorithm for Ion values.  It is useful when determining whether two Ion values represent the same value, or determining whether an Ion value has changed.  For example, a storage system might use Ion hashes to assert the integrity of its data.

Additionally, a reference implementation of Ion Hash written in Java is available as open source software.
