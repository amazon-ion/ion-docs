Ion Path Extraction API aims to combine the convenience of a DOM API with the speed of a streaming API.

The user can register search paths and callbacks with the extractor that will read the Ion document in
the most efficient way looking for the registered paths. When it matches a search path it will invoke
the correspondent callback.
